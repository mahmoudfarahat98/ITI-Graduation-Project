# ITI-Graduation-Project

This project details the development of an automated Examination System tailored for the Information Technology Institute. The system is engineered to streamline the management of exams, questions, students, instructors, and courses, providing a robust solution for handling various examination-related processes. Key features include automated exam generation, student answer recording, result calculation, and dynamic reporting. The database is constructed with a comprehensive schema that supports these functionalities and integrates seamlessly with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and Power BI for insightful data visualization. These tools enable the creation of detailed reports and interactive dashboards that provide valuable insights into academic performance, instructor effectiveness, and overall departmental operations, thereby facilitating informed decision-making. The project emphasizes a systematic approach to database creation, data extraction, and report generation, enhancing the efficiency and quality of the examination management process.
